# `it's electric` #

`it's electric` will poll a [TED 5000](http://www.theenergydetective.com/) (or TED Pro, or Current Cost) home energy monitoring system for data, store it in a database, and publish it as a graph on a website. You can zoom in and see second-by-second data, even long afterward. It's faster than Footprints and allows finer detail than Google PowerMeter. And, it's easy to make your data publicly available over the web.
